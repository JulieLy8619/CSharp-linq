# lab08-linq

We were tasked to read in a JSON file and then use LINQ to answer the following questions
- Output all of the neighborhoods in this data list
- Filter out all the neighborhoods that do not have any names
- Remove the Duplicates
- Rewrite the queries from above, and consolidate all into one single query.
- Rewrite at least one of these questions only using the opposing method (example: Use LINQ instead of a Lambda and vice versa.)

At this time, it just runs, it is not interactive with a user.

# Solution
Here is what the final list looked like (no null values or duplictes)
